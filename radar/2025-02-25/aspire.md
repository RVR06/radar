You can also easily plug in [external resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/orchestrate-resources?tabs=docker#express-external-service-resources) or [existing docker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/orchestrate-resources?tabs=docker#express-external-service-resources) to complement your setup, which is challenging to do with plain old docker compose.
