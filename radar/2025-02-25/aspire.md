.NET Aspire is so comfortable to work with that it feels like an old friend. It provides a modern, efficient, and productive environment for building applications. With its rich set of libraries, tools, and frameworks, .NET Aspire empowers developers to create high-quality software with ease.
You can also easily integrate [external resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/orchestrate-resources?tabs=docker#express-external-service-resources) or [existing Docker containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/orchestrate-resources?tabs=docker#express-external-service-resources) to complement your setup, which is challenging to achieve with plain Docker Compose. All components communicate seamlessly.
