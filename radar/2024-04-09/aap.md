After being exposed to an early release of *Facilitating Software Architecture* ebook from *Andrew Harmel-Law* at *O'reilly* edition, I decided to give a try with Architecture Advice Process. AAP is a mechanism that allows organizations to decentralize the architecture decision-making. Indeed, instead of relying on a **few architects solely accountable and responsible** for the architecture, it fosters the involvement of **all development stakeholders** in the decision-making process. Anyone can make an architectural decision **provided that** people who might be impacted by the decision and the experts in that area are consulted.
