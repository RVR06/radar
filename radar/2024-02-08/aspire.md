Crafting Cloud friendly, Cloud native system or any ecosystem is hard. We need to shift our mind on many topics, changing the way we articulate our code base, coping with a lot of new concepts - such as resilience, observability, authentication, failure - and all of those Dev/Ops mindset that we are not used to. Last but not least, we have to manage a compelling stack we can daily exercise. It often ends up with scripts, helpers, hacks and more. And eventually, it becomes both hard to operate and maintain. And it is not that portableâ€¦ And, at the end of the day, it is not our job. We are building application, not pipeline or engine. Microsoft luckily made the same journey and recently beta released .NET Aspire, the next Big Thing.
