Building cloud-friendly, cloud-native systems or ecosystems is challenging. We need to shift our thinking on many topics, changing how we structure our codebase and adapting to numerous new concepts—such as resilience, observability, authentication, and failure handling—along with DevOps mindsets we're not accustomed to. Additionally, we must manage a complex stack for daily development. This often results in scripts, helpers, workarounds, and more. Eventually, it becomes difficult to operate and maintain, and it's not very portable. Ultimately, this isn't our primary job—we're building applications, not pipelines or engines. Fortunately, Microsoft went through the same journey and recently released .NET Aspire as a beta, the next big thing.
