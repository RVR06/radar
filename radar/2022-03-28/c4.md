To easily maintain and keep architecture documentation up to date, a second approach, named architecture as code, enables to document the architecture design based on textual model.Decision has been made to combine both C4 Model and architecture as code to bring a robust strategy for documenting and maintain any architecture design. To support migration from legacy drawing (using software like Lucidchart) to authoring (using IDE), a dedicated bootcamp and a companion extension has been shaped.
