To easily maintain and keep architecture documentation up to date, a second approach called "architecture as code" enables documenting architecture design based on textual models. The decision was made to combine both the C4 Model and architecture as code to create a robust strategy for documenting and maintaining architecture designs. To support migration from legacy drawing tools (like Lucidchart) to authoring (using IDEs), a dedicated bootcamp and companion extension have been developed.
