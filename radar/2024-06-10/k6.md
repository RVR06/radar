Assessing if and how an application will scale - and scale the way we expect it to - is not straightforward. We do have to define the scaling traits (are we talking about concurrent users? increase in data size? increase in data volumetry? increase in activity? all of those?). We also have to define the protocol we want to assess hypothesis with, the figures we want to surface and their matching reading grid, the infrastructure we need to setup, â€¦
To cope with those yards, some dedicated frameworks emerged and smooth the path for new-comers. K6 from Grafana Labs is one of them.
