Get rid of Scrum methodology and replace it with Kanban. Scrum is often misapplied in practice, leading to rigid processes that hinder team flexibility and responsiveness. Kanban, on the other hand, promotes continuous delivery and allows teams to adapt to changing priorities more effectively. By adopting Kanban, teams can visualize their workflow, limit work in progress, and focus on delivering value without the constraints of fixed sprints and roles.
