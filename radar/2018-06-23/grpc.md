Embrace gRPC for efficient, scalable, and language-agnostic communication in microservices architectures. Leverage its robust features like bi-directional streaming, built-in authentication, and support for multiple programming languages to enhance inter-service communication and improve overall system performance. Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) serve as the interface definition language (IDL) for gRPC, enabling efficient serialization and deserialization of structured data, which is crucial for high-performance applications.
