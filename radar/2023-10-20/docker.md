Docker is a powerful ecosystem which has revolutionized software development a long while ago. If we scope discussion to build pipeline, leveraging docker-based agents to offload build workload comes with a lot of advantages. Black-boxing build environments brings flexibility and scalability, but sacrifices a bit of control. It becomes harder to intervene during the build workflow. And eventually, we end up with a mixed feeling like leveraging docker is great but it will be even greater if I could build more modular pipelines mixing local processing and containerized one.
