Docker is a powerful ecosystem that revolutionized software development some time ago. When we focus the discussion on build pipelines, using Docker-based agents to offload build workloads offers many advantages. Black-boxing build environments provides flexibility and scalability, but sacrifices some control. It becomes harder to intervene during the build workflow. Eventually, we end up with mixed feelingsâ€”using Docker is great, but it would be even better if we could build more modular pipelines that combine local processing with containerized components.
