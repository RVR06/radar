Set up the AAP ecosystem by provisioning a dedicated GitHub repository to host AAP discussions and decisions, using GitHub's built-in discussion facility to foster conversation around architecture decisions while ensuring transparency and traceability. Strengthen the existing ADR initiative by introducing new ADR levels to capture local decisions at the business unit, organization, and team levels. Ease advice harvesting and exploration by using GitHub labeling and filtering capabilities.
