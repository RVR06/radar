Assessing whether and how an application will scale—and scale the way we expect it to—is not straightforward. We need to define the scaling characteristics (are we talking about concurrent users? increase in data size? increase in data volume? increase in activity? all of the above?). We also need to define the protocol we want to test our hypotheses with, the metrics we want to capture and their corresponding evaluation criteria, the infrastructure we need to set up, and more.
To address these challenges, dedicated frameworks have emerged to smooth the path for newcomers. K6 from Grafana Labs is one of them.
