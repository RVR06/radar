# Walkthrough

To support the technical decision-making process, the software industry typically leverages technology maps that provide a snapshot of the underlying technologies we build our stack upon while capturing contextual and compelling historical data. This knowledge-sharing tool serves as both a breeding ground for feeding architecture decision context upstream and as a resulting artifact that makes ADR outcomes explicit downstream. Combining ADRs with the technology radar supports teams in both internal and external communication.

Explore this Technology Radar variant to discover the paradigms, technologies, and tools I use to shape my software architecture practice over time. It serves as a living dataset that evolves alongside my understanding and experience.

I categorize each item into one of these rings:
- **Adopt**: I wholeheartedly recommend this technology. I have used it extensively over an extended period, proving its stability and utility. Items in this ring represent mature, stable technologies that form the foundation of my technology stack. The absence of recent changes to items in this ring does not indicate deprecation or obsolescence; rather, it often reflects the technology's maturity and proven reliability.
- **Trial**: I have successfully implemented this technology and suggest taking a closer look at it. The aim here is to scrutinize these items more closely with the intention of potentially elevating them to the 'Adopt' level.
- **Assess**: I have experimented with this technology and find it promising. I recommend exploring these items when you encounter a specific need for the technology in your project.
- **Hold**: This category is somewhat unique. Unlike the others, it advises discontinuing or refraining from using certain technologies. This does not necessarily imply that they are inherently bad; it may often be acceptable to use them in existing projects. However, I move items here when I believe they should no longer be employed, as I have identified better options or alternatives.

I use tags to indicate my proficiency level with each technology:
- **NOVICE**:  Basic understanding, learning phase
- **PRACTITIONER**:  Regular use, comfortable implementation
- **EXPERT**:  Deep knowledge, can teach others
- **THOUGHT LEADER**:  Innovating, contributing to community
